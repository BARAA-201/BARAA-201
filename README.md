# Hi there 👋

### I'm Baraa, I'm a Junior web developer. I've enrolled and graduated from a web development Bootcamp by YouThink Academy powered by WozU.
### I try to improve my programming skills constantly.
### I'm interested in internet security and ethical hacking and I started to study and explore it.

## What you find in my GitHub
### Will, there is not much 😁

I have some projects I worked on before and there are some random codes that I used to practice with.
